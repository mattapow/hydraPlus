# hydra+
 Python implementation of hydra+
 
 Hydra+ embeds the points into hyperbolic space. It minimizes the stress of the embedding compared to the original pairwise distances between points. The algorithm was originally implemented in R and is available at https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=hydra. See the tests for some examples.
 

## Install
```
python -m pip install scipy
python -m pip install .
```
